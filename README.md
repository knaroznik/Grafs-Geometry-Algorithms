# Graphs, Geometry and Algorithms.

## Project 1 : Nucleus of simple polygon.
First project, in which i will show how to find a nucleus of simple polygons. Demo is on scene nucelus_scene. We got here 5 most 
common cases of polygons. After clicking each button u can see how the algorithm is going.

### Classes

1. SceneBehaviour - class to instantiate buttons on the right of scene, pin on some gameobject on scene.
1. Polygon - representation of polygon, with calculations of nucleus and circuit of it, created in PolygonDrawer.
1. PolygonDrawer - class pin on polygon gameobject. It creates a polygon and draws it on scene.
1. Dot, Block, Geometry - helper classes, representation of Vector2, Line, and static class for geometry problems.

## Project 2 : Two closest points with Divide and Conquer method.
Second project, comparasion of divide and conquer algorihtm and brute algorithm.

## Project 3 : Building Kd-Tree.
## Project 4 : Triangulation of simple polygon using monotone polygons.
