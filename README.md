# Graphs, Geometry and Algorithms.

## Project 1 : Nucleus of simple polygon.
First project, in which i will show how to find a nucleus of simple polygons. Demo is on scene nucelus_scene. We got here 5 most 
common cases of polygons. After clicking each button u can see how the algorithm is going.
## Project 2 : Two closest points with Divide and Conquer method.
## Project 3 : Building Kd-Tree.
## Project 4 : Triangulation of simple polygon using monotone polygons.
